            <h1>Bead Loom</h1>
            <p>The bead loom was a drawing project with a special twist - the 400x400 loom was to be drawn in with 20x20
                squares, in the fewest lines of code possible.<br>
                This posed a special challenge, as the design we - my partner, Maya Peski, and I - settled on was quite
                complicated and was therefore difficult to automate. For example, the process of drawing a pixellated
                circle using for loops is much more difficult that that of drawing a square.<br>
                In addition to the unique challenge posed by the circle, the diagonal elements were also difficult to
                program. Since they did not follow standard movement in terms of perpendicular length and width, many of
                the diagonal elements had to be broken down into two parts that, when put together, would form the
                target shape.<br>
                Though this was a challenging project, it was very rewarding and, in my opinion, yielded very good
                results.<br>

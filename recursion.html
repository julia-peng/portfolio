            <h1>Recursion</h1>
            <p>The Oxford Dictionary defines recursion as "the process of repeating a function, each time applying it to
                the result of the previous stage". Recursion, in the context of Java, accomplishes just this. It solves
                problems by defining them as increasingly simple components, until a definite answer is found. This
                definite answer is called the base case. Then, using the base case, the program rebuilds the answer by
                applying its value to the simplified question.<br>
                Let us examine recursion using the Fibonacci sequence. First, identify a way to break down the Fibonacci
                sequencing into simpler parts. The value of the fifth number can be defined as the sum of the fourth and
                third numbers. This pattern continues down the sequence, with the fourth number being the sum of the
                third and second numbers and the third being the sum of the second and first numbers. With this, the
                program has identified its base case, where the values of the first and second numbers in the Fibonacci
                sequence are known to be 0 and 1.<br>
                A recursive Java implementation of the Fibonacci sequence can be seen below.<br>
                F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
            </p>
            <code><pre>public int static fibonacci (int n) {
    //base case
    if(n = 1)
        return 1; //we know that the second number (index 1) in the Fibonacci sequence is 1. Thus, when the
                  //method is called to find the second number, return 1.
    else if(n=1)
        return 0; //we know that the first number (index 0) in the Fibonacci sequence is 0. Thus, when the
                  //method is called to find the first number, return 0.
    else //recursive portion
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-1); //modelling F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
}</pre></code>
            <p>A common mistake made when using recursion in program is not being mindful of the base case. Since
                recursive methods backtrack until they hit a definite value, it is crucial to define this definite
                value. Without defining this, the method undergoes recursion infinitely, throwing a StackOverflowError.

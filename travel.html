                        <h2>The Rockies</h2>
                        <img src="images/banff.jpg" alt="Lake Morraine" width=50%><br>
                        I went to Banff in the summer of 2022, with my brother, mother and 3 longtime
                        family friends. It was a wonderful, absolutely stunning experience. As we drove towards the
                        national park from Calgary, the outline of the mountains slowly became more defined and, after
                        some times, we were in front of these monumental structures. The sheer scale of the mountains
                        brought a quite calm about the whole place - we were but specks of dust in this world's expanse.

                        <h2>England</h2>
                        <img src="images/england.jpg" alt="The Big Ben" width=50%><br>
                        England is a country I hold affection for, as I was born two hours outside of Manchester. The
                        last time I visited it was in the summer of 2022, with my brother and father. There, I got to
                        see family that I hadn't seen in over ten years, revisit places from my childhood and reflect on
                        a life that I could very well have lived.

                        <h2>Switzerland</h2>
                        <img src="images/switzerland.jpeg" alt="Lake Geneva" width=50%><br>
                        Switzerland, though initially meant as an in-between on our drive from France to Italy, may
                        have been my favourite destination of the whole Europe trip. The sheer drama depicted in the
                        Swiss scenery was just <em>breathtaking</em>. At every turn, mountains could be found in
                        sight - little huts and mountain goats abound in the scenery. Switzerland's natural beauty
                        was just stunning.

                        <h2>The Maritimes</h2>
                        <img src="images/maritimes.jpg" alt="A Rock Formation on Prince Edward Island" width=42%><br>
                        I visited the Maritimes provinces in the summer of 2021 with my mother, brother and two cats
                        in haul. Though the sights may not have been as exciting or historically significant as some
                        of my other destinations, this trip remains one of my favourite. The quiet calm of just
                        seeing isolation in these provinces brought a peace about the whole trip - it was blissfully
                        <em>normal</em>.

                        <h2>France</h2>
                        <img src="images/paris.jpg" alt="Paris, France" width=42%><br>
                        In addition to my trip to England, my brother, father and I went on a tour of Western Europe.
                        Among these countries was France. Wow - the streets of Paris were simply <em>stunning</em> -
                        France's deep cultural ties to aristocracy and art were shown off in every single street
                        corner. In addition to that, the countryside was nothing to scoff at either - the rolling
                        hills and lush greenery seemed straight out of a period painting.

                        <h2>Italy</h2>
                        <img src="images/rome.jpg" alt="The Trevi Fountain" width=47.5%><br>
                        Italy was the final destination of our Europe trip. We were determined to make the long drive
                        down to Rome and, once we were there, I was taken aback by the proud display of heritage
                        found in Rome. Even just roaming the streets, the Roman heritage is apparent, with historic
                        monuments scattered generously throughout the city.

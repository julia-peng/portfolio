                            Cooking is a skill I picked up at a young age, while my Mother worked long hours. Starting
                            off as a necessity, it is something I have come to really enjoy over the years.<br>
                            My passion for cooking developed over the pandemic, when I had the time and energy to spare
                            to learn how to make more intricate dishes than previously before. I gradually gained an
                            understanding of how cooking traditions evolve from geographic and social conditions, as
                            well as the science behind the food we eat. <br>
                            Nowadays, my favourite things to cook are simpler dishes originating from the more affluent
                            regions of the world. As these regions historically had the money to afford quality
                            ingredients, dishes that place emphasis on the ingredients' simpler flavours naturally
                            evolved.

                            While I wouldn't consider myself a music aficionado, it's something I still enjoy quite a
                            bit.<br>
                            When I'm working, you'll find me listening to music all the time through my headphones,
                            switching tracks constantly and, oftentimes, listening to the same song on repeat until I
                            can't stand it anymore. <br>
                            My friend introduced me to the joy of listening to albums in full a while back, and it's
                            become one of my favourite ways to enjoy music. Hearing not only the effort that went into
                            making a song sonically perfect, but also crafting an experience through their arrangement
                            in an album has brought me a new perspective on music making and its intricacies. <br>
                            Here are my three favourite albums:

                            Reading is something that I've always enjoyed. I remember that, when I was very young, my
                            mother would always be telling me to stop reading as it started taking time away from my
                            studying. The joke's on her - I don't read nearly enough now. Ha.<br>
                            My favourite type of books to read are those with a deeper, analyzable meaning. Though I
                            still enjoy fantasy books and other similar genres, to me, the most magical part of reading
                            is staying up for nights and dissecting the minute details in your mind. The magic that is
                            found in sketching out the world on the ceiling, abstracting the minds of the characters and
                            taking in the weight of the author's words cements the care put into the creation of a
                            wonderful story.<br>
                            My favourite author is Haruki Murakami, a Japanese author who is very well known in China.
                            The first book of his that I read was <em>Norwegian Wood</em>, a beautiful coming-of-age
                            with a
                            haunting theme of grief. His ability to discuss the heaviest of topics using the most
                            delicate of words has become something that I find great satisfaction in experiencing. <br>
                            Reading isn't a hobby I participate in as often as I'd like to be doing anymore. Let's hope
                            that changes.
